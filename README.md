ABSTRACT
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNAs with a covalently closed loop. Although extensively studied in animals, circRNAs in plant, particularly under biotic stress, remain largely une plored. This study analyzes circRNA dynamics in during Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) infection. Public datasets and in-house RNA-se libraries were used to identify circRNAs and assess their e pression across three time points post-infection (10, 17, and 24 days). A total of 12 circRNAs were identified as differentially e pressed between infected and control plants. Si circRNAs were selected for e perimental validation based on size and e pression level. RT-PCR using divergent primers confirmed the presence of circ6 (csa_circ_2229), while RT-PCR using convergent primers and previous RNase R treatment validated circ1 (csa_circ_001928). Circ1 was cloned and overe pressed in , confirming successful e pression via RT-PCR and Dot Blot. Finally, overe pression of circ1 in . followed by HSVd infection revealed increased viroid accumulation, suggesting a potential pro-viroid role for this circRNA.
