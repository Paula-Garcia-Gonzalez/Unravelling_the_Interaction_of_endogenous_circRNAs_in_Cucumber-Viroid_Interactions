# ABSTRACT
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNAs with a covalently closed loop. Although extensively
studied in animals, circRNAs in plant, particularly under biotic stress, remain largely unexplored. This study
analyzes circRNA dynamics in _Cucumis sativus_ during Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) infection. Public datasets and
in-house RNA-se libraries were used to identify circRNAs and assess their expression across three time points
post-infection (10, 17, and 24 days). A total of 12 circRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between
infected and control plants. Six circRNAs were selected for experimental validation based on size and
expression level. RT-PCR using divergent primers confirmed the presence of circ6 (csa_circ_2229), while RT-
PCR using convergent primers and previous RNase R treatment validated circ1 (csa_circ_001928). Circ1 was
cloned and overexpressed in _Nicotiana Benthamiana_, confirming successful expression via RT-PCR and Dot
Blot. Finally, overe pression of circ1 in _Cucumis sativus_ followed by HSVd infection revealed increased viroid
accumulation, suggesting a potential pro-viroid role for this circRNA.
